LMS Desktop Assistant v1.12.2
-----------------------------
September 26, 2011

LMS Desktop Assistant v1.12
---------------------------
September 15, 2011

Functionality:

* In Chamilo 2.0, published objects will now correctly be shared with other course administrators.
* A new type of question (Type gaps dropdown) has been added. This type's syntax is the same as "Fill in the Gaps", but the multiple answers in gaps are shown as dropdown menu on the platform.

Fixed Bugs:
----------
* The default platform URL is now correctly set to the https protocol.
* Trying to generate statistics from Chamilo 2.0 no longer crashes the program.
* A bug that occurred when checking if an object existed on the Chamilo 2.0 platform has been fixed.

* The method to scan for a question after it's been uploaded has been improved so it can't get disrupted by the name cutoff in the repository view.


Older version updates:

LMS Desktop Assistant v1.11.4
-----------------------------
June 9, 2011

Fixed Bugs:
----------
* Fixed the problem that occured when uploading an exercise without description to Chamilo 2.0.


LMS Desktop Assistant v1.11.3
-----------------------------
June 9, 2011

Functionality:
-------------
* Removed the now-obsolete "Chamilo 2.0 test" platform.

Fixed Bugs:
----------
* Publishing now works again on Chamilo; it was broken because of changes on the platform.


LMS Desktop Assistant v1.11.2
-----------------------------
June 6, 2011

Functionality:
-------------
* A failsafe has been added to the Chamilo platform so the program checks if a folder has been created even if the platform returned an error after the creation request.


LMS Desktop Assistant v1.11.1
-----------------------------
May 31, 2011

Functionality:
-------------
* When converting files to PDF, the filenames of the generated files will have all spaces replaced by underscores, to mimick the behaviour of files downloaded from the platforms. This option can be disabled in the Preferences window.

Fixed Bugs:
----------
* When converting documents to PDF and splitting them on style, the converted filenames had an extra underscore added to the end (in v1.11). This is now fixed.


LMS Desktop Assistant v1.11
---------------------------
May 27, 2011

Functionality:
-------------
* Files can now be manually marked as "already synchronized", so they will not be uploaded until they have been modified. This is handy to prevent reuploading of exercises which were already uploaded using the Exercises tab.
* Files can now be manually marked as "not synchronized", to force a reupload on the next synchronization.
* A portable version of the program is now available instead of the old non-administrator install.
* The program now supports the Chamilo 2.0 platform.
   Remark: The Chamilo implementation has support for the new advanced options of the "Fill in the Blanks" exercises. However, if you are using a version of Chamilo which does not yet support advanced options like default scores, you should use the platform "Chamilo 2.0 test" for better compatibility.

Fixed bugs:
----------
* The file selected in the synchronization tree view will no longer be marked as 'modified' after opening and closing the Preferences window.
* When a setting was not found in the settings file, all settings read after it would revert to the built-in defaults. This has been fixed.

Internal changes:
----------------
* Spreadsheets and presentations are now included in the system of supported file types. This will allow implementation of (PDF conversions for) other spreadsheet and presentation file types besides MS Office without needing any changes in the program's core. The new implementations simply have to be added to the list of supported file types, with the correct type identification.
* Optimized the fetching of course data on login.

---------------------------
January 3, 2011

Fixed bugs:

LMS Desktop Assistant v1.04
---------------------------
June 9, 2010

For v1.04, LMS Desktop Assistant's synchronization tool has been drastically optimized. The biggest optimization is its new ability to recognise which exercises or PDF parts read from a document are unmodified and don't need to be reuploaded to the platform. This means that exercises documents can be expanded with new exercises without influencing the exercises in it that are already on the platform.

Note that these changes only apply to the synchronization tool: uploads performed from the Exercises and PFD conversion tabs will still overwrite any existing items on the platform.


Change log for LMS Desktop Assistant v1.04:

Functionality:
-------------
* When scanning exercises from a document, the program now removes any empty elements at the end of the exercises, questions and answers.
* The problem that caused text colors to be removed from exercises has been solved.
* Blocks of underlined colored text in exercises are now underlined in the same color as the text.
* When re-synchronizing a subject after adding new courses to it, it no longer crashes or uploads things to courses which aren't linked to the Subject.
* Synchronization will now only upload the modified and new exercises scanned from an exercises document.
* Synchronization will now only upload the modified and new PDFs converted from a Word document.
* When updating an existing exercise on Dokeos, the old questions are now actually deleted from the platform instead of orphaned.
* When only the options of an exercise are changed after synchronization, the exercise will not be reuploaded completely. Only the options will be changed.
* Vector-based MS Word clipart images used in exercises are now correctly converted to high-quality PNG.
* The Dokeos platform removes leading and trailing from gaps answers before evaluating them. To prevent the platform from having impossible questions, the program will now do the same to the gaps answers scanned from documents.

Internal changes:
----------------
* Abstraction of document types and platforms now uses additional DocumentInfo and PlatformInfo objects, to make it easier to add new ones.
